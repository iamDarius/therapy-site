        <h4> What To Expect</h4>
        <p>When you get to my office, expect your initial experience to be similar to a doctor's appointment.
            When you enter the waiting room you will see a button on the wall with my name, press the button so
            I know you have arrived and have a seat in the waiting room.</p>

        <p>During your initial visit with me you will be asked to come 15 minutes early so you can fill out the new
            patient paperwork. This consists of my Informed Consent packet, HIPAA Guidelines, Releases (as
            needed), and basic information about you. I will also have you fill out some short questionnaires
            regarding symptoms and concerns.</p>
        <p>During your first session we will review this paperwork, address any questions or concerns, and you
            will be given a copy to take home and read more thoroughly. Also, during the session I will try my
            best to understand your needs and what brought you to me. I will do this by taking a
            history/background, concerns, worries, etc. We will discuss scheduling and treatment goal setting
            also. It is important for you to give me input/feedback in this process so I know what is important
            for you to be working on in treatment. Throughout your treatment we will revisit your treatment
            goals and reassess as needed.</p>
        <p> Open communication is always best in this process in order to meet your goals and get the best
            possible care. I am here to help you meet your needs and provide you with guidance to make positive
            changes in your life.</p>
        </p>
        <h4> What are my Rates?</h4>
        <p>My rate for a 50 minute session is $100. I accept cash, checks and credit cards.</p>

        <h4> What Insurances do I Accept?</h4>
       <ul>
           <li>Anthem</li>
           <li>  Anthem Healthkeepers Plus</li>
            <li>  Cigna</li>
            <li>  Optima</li>
            <li> Optima Family Care</li>
            <li> Tricare</li>
            <li> ChampVa</li>
            <li>Aetna</li>
            <li> United Behavioral Health </li>
            <li> Medicare/Palmetto Part B</li>
            <li>Magellan Medicaid </li>
       </ul> 
        <p>Please check your coverage carefully by asking the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Do I have mental health insurance benefits?</li>
            <li> What is my deductible and has it been met?</li>
            <li> Is there a limit on session per year?</li>
            <li> What is my copay?</li>
        </ul>
<p>I also do not file to secondary or tertiary insurance companies. You may also use a “superbill” to file for any out of pocket costs not covered by your primary policy.
Please note that superbills can only be generated to accounts paid in full. If your copay/out of pocket fee from your primary insurance is not received at the time of service, a superbill cannot be generated.</p>

<p>For other insurance plans that I am not a part of you can pay out of pocket and possibly be reimbursed by your insurance company by submitting a superbill that I can provide. Please contact your insurance company to ask if they can do this prior to seeing me. </p>

        <h4> Reasons to consider Private Pay or “out of pocket”</h4>
        
        <p>Because insurance companies only cover care that is “medically necessary”, i.e. that which has a recognized mental health diagnosis attached, insurance does not cover a full range of concerns that people bring to therapy. People seek counseling for many reasons, ranging from depression, anxiety to concerns with identity, sexuality, spirituality, gender issues, transitions to a new phase of life.
        Some clients choose not to use insurance to defer the cost of therapy because they do not want their therapy to be limited by diagnoses, time frame, and goals to be dictated by insurance companies.
        Many clients are also concerned about privacy. In order to obtain reimbursement, the insurance company has to know personal information about you and can review your records at their discretion. Your diagnosis is something that is seen by multiple people at the insurance company and can be shared with other insurance companies – life/disability/future health insurance companies and the government. Some employers can even request you release the information to them, which can have an impact on the status of your employment or, in some cases, impact your ability to advance.</p>

        <h4>What is your Cancellation Policy?</h4>
          <p>  If you do not show up for your scheduled therapy appointment and have not notified me at least 24 hours in advance you will be required to pay a $50 late cancel/no show fee. </p>
